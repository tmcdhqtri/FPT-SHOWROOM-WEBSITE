Not to mention it is gorgeous. We recently had a G 63 and took it off-road, where it is meant to be driven. Here is what we said:
“Loose surfaces and steep hills proved no match for the G, and we never once rubbed its belly or those precariously positioned pipes on anything of consequence. We became concerned that we were not pushing the G hard enough to learn anything, meaning we were going to have to take some risks lest the outing prove uninformative. But then we remembered one key detail: This isn’t just a G-Wagen; it is an AMG. Slow and steady? Technical rock crawling? Pfft. And that brought us to Holly Glen.
“The Glen is near the entrance to the park, and put simply, it’s a dirt race track. It’s not a fancy one. There’s no start/finish line labeled, nor any accommodation for spectators or officials or anything of that nature. Rather, it’s simply a one-way loop wide enough for a half-dozen dirt bikes or a couple of 4x4s, long enough to be "high-speed" relative to the technical obstacles and hill-climbs elsewhere in the park, but neither straight nor flat enough to allow you to build up a ton of speed that you may not be able to bleed off before the next jump or blind corner. There are a couple of posted rules (no ATVs, no going against the flow of traffic, that sort of thing) but nothing that said "take your rich-boy toy and turn around." In other words, perfect.
“With everything in the G 63’s dynamic select set to (Stupid) we bombed around the course while onlookers in Wranglers held up phones, likely hoping to capture a stupid rich person doing a stupid rich thing in their stupid-expensive SUV. Sorry to disappoint, blue Wrangler guy. Catching air and just generally having an absolute blast, the G 63 got to do exactly what it is good at: converting gasoline to noise in the most exuberant, entertaining fashion possible.
“And when we say it’s good, man, is it. The G 63 may look barebones for its price tag, but underneath its simplistic, boxy shape and clackity-clack door latches lies a tech-forward powertrain that can translate a few millimeters of steering input and pedal travel into a spectacle of sound and flying sand. “Trail” mode dials most of the nannies back considerably, and the remaining safeties lie dormant in the G’s electronic periphery until you do something particularly ham-fisted.
“What that might be exactly, we can’t say. Despite taking off-camber hills at near-full lock with all four corners sending massive rooster tails 20 feet in the air, getting all four wheels off the ground, and churning so deep into loose sand that we felt it brush along the big G’s belly, we were never scolded by any of its numerous and heavily intertwined systems. And when we were done, we put 10 PSI back in each tire, flipped Dynamic Select back over to its Comfort setting, and set off for home with nary a new rattle, squeak or shimmy. It was as if none of it ever happened.”')

The Vietnamese automaker has two SUVs queued up to sell here, and the public will be able to see them for the first time as soon as this week. 
According to a report from Automotive News, VinFast is scheduled to open six showrooms in California this Thursday, July 14. Like Tesla, they are not dealerships per se. The showrooms will give potential buyers a place to ask questions, look at the car, schedule a test drive and configure one for purchase, but they will be direct-to-customer sales. They will circumvent the traditional dealership system and will be located in high-traffic areas like shopping centers in Santa Monica, San Diego, San Mateo, Corte Madera, Commerce and Berkeley. 
The move may be a good one, as the article points out that the California New Car Dealers Association says EVs took 15% of the market in the first quarter of 2022. Nationally, the percentage of electric sales is below 3.
The two models are dubbed the VF8, which is around the size of a Volkswagen Tiguan, and the larger VF9. The dual-motor VF8 will have the option of 348-horsepower and 368 pound-feet of torque in the base Eco trim for $40,700, or a more powerful Plus trim generating 402 horses and 457 pound-feet for $48,000. The VF9 will only be available with the latter drivetrain and will cost $55,500 for the base and $61,000 for the top trim.
Notably, however, these prices do not include the battery. VinFast says that initially batteries will be leased in order to assuage concerns about the high cost of replacement. Two batteries packs will be offered, an 82 kilowatt-hour standard-range unit will offer approximately 260 miles in range for the Eco, and 248 for the Plus. An extended-range 87.7 kilowatt-hour capacity will bump those numbers to 292 and 277, respectively. 
The battery lease starts at $35 a month for the VF8 and $44 for the VF9. The plan includes 310 miles, and exceeding the limit will cost 11 cents a mile for the VF8, or 15 cents a tick for the VF9. Do not worry, there is an unlimited mileage plan as well, which will cost $110 a month and $160 a month for the VF8 and VF9, respectively. Automotive News says that VinFast will freeze the monthly cost for the lifetime of the vehicle to encourage orders this year, implying that these rates might increase as time goes on.
With the lease, VinFast will replace the batteries for free once they can no longer charge above 70%. The company will also offer the option of purchasing the battery entirely for a one-time cost sometime in 2024.
VinFasts ambitious plan has seen the establishment of a U.S. headquarters in Los Angeles last year, but these first six showrooms are just the beginning. It plans to deliver its first cars, open 24 more U.S. showrooms, and break ground on a North Carolina factory by the end of the year.')

It’s a V8-powered, mid-engine sports car with nearly 500 horsepower and 470 pound feet of torque, a dual-clutch transmission and head-turning looks, all for under $60K when it was released. You’d be hard-pressed to find that kind of performance bargain anywhere else. As good as the price was, winning one from Omaze sounds even better.
Here are the specs of the Corvette in question, according to Omaze:
Maximum Seating: 2
Engine: 6.2L V8
Drivetrain: RWD 
Exterior color: TBD
Interior color: TBD
Maximum horsepower: 495 hp
Maximum torque: 470 lb-ft
Acceleration: 0–60 in 2.9 seconds
Top speed: 194 mph
Fuel consumption: 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined
Fuel capacity: 18.5 gallons
Approximate retail value: $84,000 
Cash alternative: $63,000
Special features: Z51 performance package, 3LT trim, carbon fiber accents, 19”/20” rear alloy wheels, fully digital gauge cluster with head-up display, 8” HD color infotainment system with touchscreen and navigation, driver-focused cockpit with two-spoke, squared-off racing-inspired steering wheel, 14-speaker Bose Performance Series sound system.
Here’s what we said about the mid-engine Corvette in our first-drive review:
“The Corvette Stingray we drove at Spring Mountain, pictured above, is equipped with the Z51 track package. It adds an electronic limited-slip differential, larger Brembo brakes with four-piston monobloc calipers, enhanced cooling, Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires, a specific axle ratio, the performance exhaust, front splitter and two-piece rear spoiler that together add up to 400 pounds of downforce, and the track-tuned FE3 suspension (the base is FE1 and there is no FE2) that alters the springs, sway bars, dampers and electronic calibrations. You can enhance all of that with the optional $1,895 FE4 magnetic suspension, a bigger wing and a pair of upgraded seats. While we did not get a chance to try the $1,495 mid-grade GT2 seats, we recommend trying out the $1,995 top-of-the-line Competition Sport seats before placing your order — both of your Autoblog test drivers are on the slender side and found the seat bottom uncomfortably pinchy. The standard GT1 seats (pictured below) were fine in that regard and still provide adjustable side bolsters that kept us sufficiently in place on the track. The low roof and roll structure also caused headroom issues for this pair of 6-foot-plus drivers, especially with helmets on the track.
“Much has been made that the C8 is not available with a traditional manual transmission, but it doesn’t have a traditional automatic, either. Frankly, both would be out of place in what is effectively a mid-engine supercar capable of blitzing from zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds. On the track, the new eight-speed dual-clutch automated manual developed by GM and Tremec is smart enough to shift at the right time most of the time, but there were nevertheless a few odd downshift choices and moments when pulling a paddle was needed. That virtually never happens when using the most aggressive settings of Porsche PDK or Mercedes AMG’s automated manual, but this is a critique concerning degrees of excellence. GM and Tremec should be applauded for their effort.
“So too should the Z51 package’s fat Brembo brakes that took lap after lap of pounding while maintaining their reassuring pedal feel. That pedal itself is also nicely placed for left-foot braking, which can’t be said for Porsche’s.”
You’re probably asking yourself, what does it take to win? First of all, according to Omaze, "no donation or payment is necessary to enter or win this sweepstakes." If you do choose to donate, $10 will get you 20 entries, while $50 will get you 500 entries and $100 will get you 1,200 entries.
The donations themselves benefit The 500 Festival Foundation. According to Omaze, “The 500 Festival Foundation supports the 500 Festival in its mission to produce life-enriching events and programs that celebrate the spirit and legacy of the Indianapolis 500, fostering a positive impact on the city of Indianapolis and state of Indiana. Your generosity can ensure everyone has access to the 500 Festival’s free youth education, health and fitness, and leadership development programs.”')

He was not sure what it was, but the Formula One driver knew that it potentially raised the risk of his car exploding in flames and him being stuck inside.
“I did not know where I was because I was upside down, and the next thing I felt was some leaking. I was not sure if it was from my body or from the car,” he said. “I knew if a fire started it would be difficult to get out, so I switched my engine off and then everything was fine.”
Zhou, a 23-year-old Chinese driver for Alfa Romeo, on Thursday matter-of-factly explained his agonizing wait to be freed from his car following a terrifying first-lap crash at last Sunday British Grand Prix. The car was wedged between fencing and a tire barrier at the first corner and rescue crews struggled to reach him in such an unusual position.
With thoughts of fire racing through his mind, Zhou said he also held his head to stop it bumping against the side, but didn’t know much else about his position.
The crash at Silverstone brought the race to an immediate halt after the car flipped and slid upside-down across the gravel and over a tire wall into the retaining fence. The car was skidding on the halo, a frontal cockpit protection device, with Zhous helmet frighteningly close to the track surface. Then it went airborne.
Zhou still can’t explain how he walked away with minor bruising.
“I had a little bit of bruising but it was all fine after one day. I don’t know how I walked out with such little impact on my body," Zhou said ahead of this weekends Austrian GP in Spielberg. “It’s nice to be back here and especially not having such a long time. So you don’t think about what happened, with the questions, you just go straight into preparation ... If you had a summer break just after that it would be terrible, you would be thinking about the crash repeatedly."
He processed the incident out of his mind remarkably fast.
“I was happy mentally just having one day off and then went back to checking my physical condition. For me it wasn’t a concern," he said. "Obviously there’s times you do something and you need a bit of mental help, but this time I didn’t feel it was needed.”
Zhou was looking forward to Fridays sprint race qualifying at the Red Bull Ring.
“No fears. I was able to take it quite calmly apart from not looking too much at the pictures, because that car was in a bad state," he said. "What I remember is that I had a massive hit and flipped over, traveling at a very constant speed, quite fast into the gravel ... It was only when I was facing downwards that I realized I was going to the barrier.”
Remarkably, Zhou was still lucid enough to analyze how best to protect himself: “I tried to release the steering wheel myself and then get into a very low position. Make sure I’m quite solid inside myself, waiting for the final impact."
Zhou again praised the halo protective device, which was added to F1 cars in 2018.
“I felt quite lucky looking back,” he said. "I don’t know how I survived, but then looking back obviously I saw the halo saved me for that.”
The race, won by Ferraris Carlos Sainz Jr., was quickly red flagged. George Russell sprinted from his Mercedes to the tire barrier to check on Zhou.
“It was really sporting of him. Shows the huge respect of the drivers," Zhou said. "Even though he wasn’t the one causing the incident. He called me after.”
Russell, who appeared to be hit from behind at the start and was knocked into Zhou, recalled his first glimpse of Zhou.
“It was him trapped in there, literally not being able to get out of the car,” Russell said Thursday. “When you have got a tire wall effectively on top of your head, blocking your exit, hanging upside down, it is just a horrible situation to be in.”
Russell thinks improvements can be made to ensure a driver is removed more quickly from the car.
"From every disaster there is an opportunity to improve as a sport, or whatever it may be," he said. “Clearly things could have been positioned a bit differently to have given him that exit.”
Race rules prevented Russell from taking the restart because his car was towed back, harsh because he rushed out to check on Zhou. He said Mercedes understood his “natural reaction” to a “horrific incident.”
IndyCar driver Callum Illot, who praised Russells actions, recalled when he helped him during a kart crash. Russell explained how he been similarly helped.
“I rolled my car in 2008. I was trapped under,” he said. “I was actually burning my arm because the exhaust was stuck on top of me. This other driver stopped to lift the car off me and help me out of there.”
The halo device on the cars was once very divisive in F1. While four-time F1 champion Sebastian Vettel was an early vocal advocate of it, seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton was among its critics.
Not anymore, not after last Sunday and last September, when Max Verstappens Red Bull car landed on top of his at the Italian GP.
"The (governing body) FIA have done an incredible job to improve safety. I also want to acknowledge the late, great (race director) Charlie (Whiting), who was really fundamental in getting us this halo, " Hamilton said. “It saved my life last year, it saved several drivers lives. Whilst we were werent always supportive of it initially because of how it looked, I remember (Whiting) telling us it was 17% improvement in safety, and we could not ignore that.”
Alex Albon of Williams was flung into the pit wall last Sunday after being struck by Vettel from behind as drivers tried to avoid the incident involving Zhou. Williams was helicoptered to hospital and discharged that evening.
“I feel fine, a little bit sore Monday,” Albon said Thursday. "It all happened very quickly. I felt I was hitting the wall and then it was like a pinball reaction.”')
